# Hackmud Script Manager

Command made for [Hackmud Scripting Environment](https://github.com/samualtnorman/hackmud-environment), which is a scripting environment for hackmud with minification, autocompletes / intellisense, and TypeScript support.

You can read about how HSM works [in my blog post](https://samual.uk/blog/js-code-transformation-niche-environment/).

## Install

1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. Run `npm install -g hackmud-script-manager`

## Usage

1. Run `#dir` in game, then `cd` to that folder
2. Name your source script file to `<name>.src.js`
3. Run `hsm minify <name>.src.js` and it will create a minified script file called `<name>.js`

> **NOTE:** If you get an error message that looks like this:
>
> ```
> [...]\AppData\Local\pnpm\hsm.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. [...]
> ```
>
> You will need to run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser` in PowerShell as an administrator.

## Features

- Minification
  - This includes auto quine cheating.
    - Supported types are null, numbers, strings, and JSON compatible objects and arrays.
    - Non JSON compatible object keys are quine cheated.
    - Member expressions are converted to index notation so the index string can be quine cheated.
    - And template literals are converted to string concatenation so the strings can be quine cheated.
  - Global variable aliasing.
  - Convert function declarations to arrow function assigned to variable hoisted to the top of the block (`function foo() { ... }` -> `let foo = () => ...`).
  - Convert `_START` and `_TIMEOUT` to `_ST` and `_TO`.
  - Remove unused parameters from the main function expression.
- Modern Javascript Syntax and Features
  - [Exponentiation Operator](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-exponentiation-operator), [Object Rest Spread](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread), [Optional Catch Binding](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-optional-catch-binding), [JSON strings](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-json-strings), [Nullish Coalescing Operator](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-nullish-coalescing-operator), [Optional Chaining](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-optional-chaining), [Logical Assignment Operators](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-logical-assignment-operators), [Numeric Seperators](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-numeric-separator), [Class Properties](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-class-properties), [Class Static Block](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-class-static-block), [Private Property `in` Object](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object).
  - Bigint literals are converted to `BigInt()` calls.
  - Hackmud already supports all modern regular expression features.
- Future JavaScript Syntax and Features
  - Warning: TypeScript doesn't support any of these features and these features may change or not actually make it into JavaScript.
  - [Decorators](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-decorators), [Do Expressions](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-do-expressions), [Function Bind](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-function-bind), [Function Sent](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-function-sent), [Partial Application](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-partial-application), [Pipeline Operator](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-pipeline-operator) (using the hack proposal and `%` as the topic token), [Throw Expression](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-throw-expressions), [Record and Tuple](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-record-and-tuple) (hash `#` syntax type).
- TypeScript Support
  - This command/module does **not** do type checking, it simply removes type annotations so you'll need to rely on your IDE or run `tsc` seperatly with `noEmit`.
- And “Cool” Unnecessary Features.
  - Variables declared outside the main function expression automatically become `#G` global variables.
  - Any code outside the function expression will only run once per top level script execution (`#FMCL`).
  - Basic seclevel verification.
    - Declaring `// @seclevel HIGHSEC` or any other seclevel before all of your code stops you from accidentally using `#ls.` or `#ns.`.
  - Import `node_modules` modules into your script using `import { foo } from "bar"` syntax.
  - `_SOURCE` is replaced with a string of the source code of the script it's in.
  - `_BUILD_DATE` is replaced with a unix timestamp (`Date.now()`) of the build date of the script.
  - `_SCRIPT_USER` is replaced with a string of the user the script was pushed to.
    - This saves characters compared to `context.this_script.split(".")[0]`.
  - `_SCRIPT_SUBNAME` is like `_SCRIPT_USER` but for the name of the script.
    - Saves characters compared to `context.this_script.split(".")[1]`.
  - `_FULL_SCRIPT_NAME` is replaced with what would be in `context.this_script`.
  - Subscript and `#db` methods names are verified.
  - All references to preprocessor syntax functions not being called are turned into arrow function wrappers e.g. `let debug = #D;` -> `let debug = v => #D(v);`.
  - `_SECLEVEL` is replaced with a number (`0` to `4`) representing the seclevel of the script.
- And Neat Weird Fixes
  - Like `.__proto__` and `.prototype` being converted to `["__proto__"]` and `["prototype"]`.
  - Illegal and unsafe strings.
    - Appearences of `_SC` and friends are either renamed or have an escape inserted so that script is legal.
    - Preprocessor syntax in strings are escaped so hackmud doesn't recognise them as preprocessor syntax.
    - And appearences of `//` in strings and regexes have a backslash inserted between to stop hackmud's overagressive comment remover from removing half the line of code.
  - Classes are actually usable now, this module replaces instances of `this` with a variable referencing what would be `this`.
  - `Function.prototype` can be referenced (but only the `.prototype` property, nothing else).
  - `Object.getPrototypeOf` and `Object.setPrototypeOf` are replaced with equivalent functions.
